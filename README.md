# MyReads Project :beginner::zap:
###### Udacity / React NanoDegree

This is fork of the starter template for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course, developed by [React Training](https://reacttraining.com). Which in turn is based on the  [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) repository

## Introduction
MyReads is a bookshelf app that allows you to search, add and categorize books you have previously read, currently reading or want to read into appropriate shelves.

## Usage

### Quickstart
Clone the repository, install dependencies and start the app using `npm start`

```
git clone https://github.com/ruargh/reactnd-project-myreads-starter.git
npm install
npm start
```
### Instructions
Upon opening the app will display the current books in your library. You can categorize a book into **Currently Reading, Want to Read & Read** bookshelves using the books drop-down.
Add more books to your library by searching for books using the search page and adding them to one of your bookshelves.

Try searching for: `Art` & `iOS`

### Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). These are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend.
